For example in a typical server setup the socket function is called to create a TCP socket descriptor which is stored in the sockfd The bind function is then used to associate the socket with a specific address and port The listen function is used to put the socket into a listening state allowing it to accept incoming connections Finally the accept function is used to accept a connection request from a client which returns a new sockfd for the accepted connection
